  <p>Hi, my name is Chase. I am a 19 year old student currently attending Vanderbilt's
      coding bootcamp and I was assigned with writing a paragraph or 2 about myself,
      so let's start from the begining shall we?

  </p>
  <p>I was born in Nashville, TN on August 28th 1999.Afterwards I soon moved to San Diego, California
      where my father was stationed while in the Marines.
      Once he got out, we moved back to Nashville. Since then 
      I have been "blessed" with two sisters and a brother. They
      look up to me so I sure hope this works out so I can finally
      be a good role model. Outside of my parent's and sibilings 
      my family includes two German Shepherds named Shadow and Sadie
      and another dog named Lily but i'm not sure what she is. She's small. 
      Let's get to the hobbies and interest. They include hanging out 
      with friends, being extremely mediocre at piano and guitar, music
      production, Hip Hop, acting on the side, video games, being a Marvel/DC/Star Wars/Game of Thrones
     nerd, watching an unhealthy amout of The Office and Breaking Bad,
     being huge Titans and Lakers fan (pre LeBron), and staring in 
     facination at my rumba for hours because I believe that is 
     the peak of human evolution in technology. So what made me get into
     coding you ask? Or maybe you didn't ask, but I'm going to tell you anyways.
     I've never really been quite sure what professional field I wanted
     to enter after High School, all I knew is I didn't want to do anything
     basic or boring. I wanted to do something not a lot of people know
     how to do, I wanted to learn a valuable skill, and in this age of
     technology people who know how to be fullstack developers are very
     valuable. I tried the college route, I majored in Psychology because
     it is something I'm very interested in, however I didn't think it
     was necessary for me to learn advanced Algebra, something I'm passionately
     not interested in, to become a Psychologist. So I left. I eventually got a job at Apple Support
     where I became an expert on iOS and MacOS to immerse myself in the tech
     field. I became intrigued with coding and thought it would be a great
     skill to learn, and that brings us to now. My main motivations for completing
     this course not only include getting a good job, and learning a valuable
     skill, but also because my mom agreed to buy me a pet Marmoset Monkey
     if I graduate.
